# import_dicom_cpp

This is just a light [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) wrapper around pydicom (https://pydicom.github.io/) launching a Python interpreter to use the capabilities of pydicom to open DICOMs in C++ applications.

It needs to be build with a Python interpreter with pydicom installed.
